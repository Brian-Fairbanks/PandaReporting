"""
The ``arcgis.geoenrichment`` module provides access to Business Analyst's 
demographic and jurisdictional areas data through enrichment, standard 
geography queries and reporting. The source for analysis can be either 
local or remote. Using a local source requires ArcGIS Pro with the 
Business Analyst extension and at least one country's data pack to be 
installed. A remote source requires access to a property configured Web 
GIS. A Web GIS can either be ArcGIS Online or an instance of ArcGIS 
Enterprise with Business Analyst.
